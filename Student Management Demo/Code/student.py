# Create a Python program for a student management system 
# where the admin can add, delete, update, and display student
# information using a menu-driven interface. 
# The system should store student data in a .txt file 
# and use functions to implement each feature.

# Hereâ€™s an example of how your menu-driven 
# student management system will look in text when run:

# Welcome to the Student Management System
# 1. Add Student
# 2. Delete Student
# 3. Update Student
# 4. Display Students
# 5. Exit
# Please choose an option (1-5):

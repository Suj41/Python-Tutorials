Student Management System
A menu-driven console application that allows an admin to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student details. It's designed to demonstrate how simple data handling and file operations work in Python.

Quiz Game
A simple quiz game where users are asked five random questions, and their final score is displayed. This project introduces Pythonâ€™s random module, utilizing random.sample() and random.choice() to shuffle and select questions dynamically.

Library Management System (CLI-based)
A command-line interface (CLI) project featuring three roles: Admin, Staff, and Customer.

a. Admin can manage (add, update, delete) staff and customer records.

b. Staff can manage books and track customers' borrow history.

c. Customers can view available books and borrow them.
Although the code is written in a basic structure without Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), the system effectively handles role-based tasks and CRUD operations.
